<summary> Coding Background </summary>

<br>
  
I began my journey into coding in April 2024, where I started learning Python to make video games. Using mainly Enki, Mimo, and Sololearn, I spent a couple of hours a day learning about Python, getting my first exposure to primitive and complex data types, mutables and immutables, "for" and "while" loops, and the general control flow of code. Beyond my declining work as a transcriptionist, I finally had some solid structure back in my life, but it still felt like I was going through the motions; I internalised what I was reading and typing, but I didn't have a way to gauge the effectiveness of my self-learning, or know what path to go down. My attention shifted away from my pipedream of making my own, commercially-successful, award-winning unicorn of a video game, and instead towards a more feasible, sustainable route towards becoming a web developer or software engineer.

Of course, I had lots of questions for myself:

* _"Am I more suited to be a back-end developer? Front-end?_
* _Can I hack it as a full-stack developer?_
* _What are my strengths and weaknesses as a programmer, and what holes are there in my application of best practices, design, and theory?_
* _How do I approach searching for work within this field without a degree?_
* _How can I prepare myself for interviews?"_

I knew I needed some sort of formal environment to guide me in the right direction, so I googled "free remote coding bootcamps UK", and found the [School Of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/). To keep myself accountable, I've kept both a diary and a substantial folder of revision notes, which has instilled a habit and love for documentation. I was also barely eligible for the [Click Start](https://instituteofcoding.org/campaign/click-start/) programme, which allowed me to achieve 20+ soft skills and tech-based certifications from Coursera, and it reaffirmed my decision to try and start a career in software development, or anything else involving creative solutions or interactive entertainment through programming.

I would say that a major reason I applied to a bootcamp rather than solely continuing my self-learning is that I wanted to challenge and enrich my character. I could spend another year or two learning to code by myself, and I might even become very proficient... yet I would have no clue about how to work effectively with others without stepping on a lot of toes, which I've come to learn is an especially important skill. I gather that tech companies want problem-solvers, logisticians, innovators, mediators, and team players more so than juniors who can code in dozens of languages and frameworks, especially in the current climate of AI-assisted solutions.

<details><summary>Week 1</summary>
  
### *Day 1* ### 

I had a great time getting to know my two team members for this week, as well as gaining an overview of what the bootcamp will entail. I knew it when I applied, but the focus on a growth mindset and group programming for the curriculum seems like the perfect way for me to develop myself not only as a programmer, but as a person. It'll be a long 16 weeks, but I truly believe this bootcamp will change my life for the better.

### *Day 2* ### 

Another productive day at the bootcamp; more reinforcement of the values of a growth mindset and the Imposter Syndrome, headed by guest speaker Ira Rainey from Microsoft. Hearing his story is especially inspiring to me, as it provides me with that hopeful optimism that I can attain a role in tech without having to pursue a degree. We also touched upon GANs, or "Generative Adversarial Networks", with the concept of a Discriminator evaluating and feeding the Generator being an interesting case of recursion. Gandalf AI was our challenge today, and I'm happy to say I reached Level 7, but in turn that's given me questions about the security of AI; it's entirely possible to brute force a decent model with prompts, allowing for private data to become exposed if it's tied to personal AI agents instead of a more generalised model.

### *Day 3* ### 

Lots of valuable learning around branching in GitHub, which is a skill I've neglected; I'm too used to going solo, so it was a welcome challenge. We also applied the AGILE methodology in completely new groups. Notably, I've had a stark change in my behaviour and mindset; I'm becoming more confident, speaking up, and involving myself instead of staying silent. A great example of this was that even after the briefest of introductions with my AGILE team, I was able to adapt and apply myself to our challenge without any mental blocks. It was certainly an intensive learning session, with it being our first 9-to-5 session, but I'm already seeing results.
