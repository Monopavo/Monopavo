# **About Me** ü¶ö

<summary> Coding Background </summary>

<br>
  
I began my journey into coding in April 2024, where I started learning Python to make video games. Using mainly Enki, Mimo, and Sololearn, I spent a couple of hours a day learning about Python, getting my first exposure to primitive and complex data types, mutables and immutables, "for" and "while" loops, and the general control flow of code. Beyond my declining work as a transcriptionist, I finally had some solid structure back in my life, but it still felt like I was going through the motions; I internalised what I was typing, but not what I was reading, nor why. I didn't have a way to gauge the effectiveness of my self-learning, or know what path to go down. My attention shifted away from my pipedream of making my own, commercially-successful, award-winning unicorn of a video game, and instead towards a more feasible, sustainable route towards becoming a web developer or software engineer.

Of course, I had lots of questions for myself:

* _"Am I more suited to be a back-end developer? Front-end?_
* _Can I hack it as a full-stack developer?_
* _What are my strengths and weaknesses as a programmer, and what holes are there in my application of best practices, design, and theory?_
* _How do I approach searching for work within this field without a degree?_
* _How can I prepare myself for interviews?"_

I knew I needed some sort of formal environment to guide me in the right direction, so I googled "free remote coding bootcamps UK", and found the [School Of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/). To keep myself accountable, I've kept both a diary and a substantial folder of revision notes, which has instilled a habit and love for documentation. I was also barely eligible for the [Click Start](https://instituteofcoding.org/campaign/click-start/) programme, which allowed me to achieve 20+ soft skills and tech-based certifications from Coursera, and it reaffirmed my decision to try and start a career in software development, or anything else involving creative solutions or interactive entertainment through programming.

I would say that a major reason I applied to a bootcamp rather than solely continuing my self-learning is that I wanted to challenge and enrich my character. I could spend another year or two learning to code by myself, and I might even become very proficient... yet I would have no clue about how to work effectively with others without stepping on a lot of toes, which I've come to learn is an especially important skill. I gather that tech companies want problem-solvers, logisticians, innovators, mediators, and team players more so than juniors who can code in dozens of languages and frameworks, especially in the current climate of AI-assisted solutions.

I'll definitely make a big reflection post once I've finished the bootcamp. If you're interested, I'm currently describing my journey on [X/Twitter](https://x.com/monopavo/status/1861434160671265147) and through my [100 Days Of Code accountability log](https://github.com/Monopavo/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md). Better to reflect upon it rather than have cognitive overload by multiple sources.
